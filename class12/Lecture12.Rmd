**Section 1.1**

Q1: What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure?     - HOH (127) and MK (1)
What does resid correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure?
    - Resid = residuals is a generic function which extracts model residuals from objects returned by modeling functions.

Select out protein only and ligand only
```{r}
protein <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
ligand <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
ligand
protein
```

  
**Section 1.2**

Write out these new PBD files so we can use them for docking.

```{r}
write.pdb(ligand, "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
write.pdb(protein,"1hsg_protein.pdb`")  
```
